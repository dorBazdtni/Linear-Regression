# Linear Regression Project Overview
In this project, I embarked on a journey to explore and implement linear regression from scratch using Python, with a focus on data manipulation, cost computation, gradient descent, and visualization. Let me walk you through the steps and insights gained during this project.

## Step 1: Data Loading and Exploration
I started by loading a dataset using the Pandas library. This dataset contained information that I wanted to use for linear regression. Using Pandas, I explored the dataset, gaining insights into its structure and characteristics. Understanding the data was crucial to determine which features to use for our regression model.

## Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing was the next essential step. I cleaned the data by handling missing values and ensuring that it was in a suitable format for our linear regression model. This involved encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

## Step 3: Cost Computation and Gradient Descent
The heart of linear regression is the cost function and gradient descent. I implemented these in pure NumPy to ensure efficient vectorized calculations. The cost function helped quantify how well our model was performing, and gradient descent was used to update model parameters iteratively.

## Step 4: Simple Linear Regression
Starting with a simple linear regression model, I used a single feature from the dataset to predict the target variable. Matplotlib was employed to visualize the results, allowing me to understand the relationship between the feature and the target variable.

## Step 5: Multivariate Linear Regression
To improve the accuracy of our predictions, I extended the model to perform multivariate linear regression. This meant using multiple features from the dataset for prediction, which often leads to more robust models.

## Step 6: Feature Selection
Feature selection became an exciting experiment. I tested different combinations of features from the dataset to determine which set of features produced the best results. This step was crucial for optimizing our linear regression model.

## Step 7: Adaptive Learning Rates
Finally, I experimented with adaptive learning rates during gradient descent. This technique involved adjusting the learning rate dynamically to speed up the convergence of the algorithm. It proved useful in optimizing the training process.
